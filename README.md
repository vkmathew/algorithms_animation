# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer 🌀

An interactive **Sorting Visualizer** built with pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, showing how various sorting algorithms organize chaos into order — one colorful bar at a time.  
No backend, no frameworks — just open it in a browser or host it on **GitHub Pages** for free.

## 🎨 Features

- Visualizes multiple algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort  
  - Insertion Sort  
  - Merge Sort  
  - Quick Sort  
  - Heap Sort  
- Adjustable **array size** and **animation speed**
- Shuffle and stop controls
- Works **completely offline**
- Clean, responsive UI with smooth animations

---

## 🧠 How It Works

Each algorithm is implemented asynchronously in JavaScript.  
The animation highlights comparisons and swaps using CSS transitions, updating DOM elements (bars) to show progress in real time.

The app uses:
- **JavaScript** for logic and animation control  
- **CSS gradients and flexbox** for visualization  
- **HTML5** for structure and simplicity
