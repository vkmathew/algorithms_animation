# 🎬 Animations by Vinu Mathew

Welcome to **Animations**, a growing collection of interactive visualizations and educational projects developed by **Vinu Mathew**.  
Each subfolder here focuses on a specific theme — from algorithmic motion to real-world process simulations — built entirely with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python (Flask)**.

## 🧠 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to **make learning visual and intuitive**.  
Each animation breaks down a complex idea — like sorting, pathfinding, or caching — into clear visual steps that anyone can understand.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open any subfolder.
2. Look for an `.html` file.
3. Double-click it — it runs directly in your browser, no setup required.

Each animation is self-contained and optimized to run **offline**.
