# 🧮 Algorithm Visualizations

This section of the **Animations** project focuses on algorithms — the step-by-step procedures that power software logic and system design.

Each folder here represents a specific category of algorithms: **sorting, searching, pathfinding, or optimization** — each demonstrated visually to explain *how* data moves and *why* it behaves that way.

## 🧠 Included Projects

| Folder | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Sorting/` | Interactive Sorting Visualizer showcasing Bubble, Insertion, Merge, Quick, and Heap Sort with explanations and Big O insights. |

## 📚 Learning Philosophy

Most people understand concepts faster when they can **see** them.  
These visualizations use animation to bridge the gap between *code and comprehension*.  
Each demo is accompanied by a plain-language explanation of:

- How the algorithm works  
- Its Big O performance notation  
- Real-world use cases  
- Comparison between different approaches  

---

## 🧩 Future Additions

Planned algorithm visualizations include:

- **Pathfinding Algorithms** (Dijkstra, A*, BFS, DFS)
- **Graph Algorithms** (Kruskal, Prim, Bellman-Ford)
- **Compression Algorithms** (Huffman, LZW)
- **Data Structure Simulators** (Heaps, Trees, Hash Maps)
